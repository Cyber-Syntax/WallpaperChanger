# **🤝 Thank you for considering to contribute!**

I was started writing a script to learn Python, but this script improved my motivation because of the psychological effect. So, I decided to open this project to the public. This is a personal project, and I want to keep it simple and focused on learning. I appreciate your interest in contributing, but please keep in mind that this project is not intended for large-scale collaboration. 

## Things that would help

### **How You Can Contribute:**

- **Suggest improvements:** If you have ideas on how to improve the script, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
- **Report bugs:** If you encounter any issues or glitches, please let me know by opening an issue with details about the problem.
- **Documentation:** Contributions to improving the documentation are always welcome.

### **What You Can Expect:**

- I will review contributions and suggestions when I can, but please note this project is in a **permanent beta phase** and my availability may be limited.
- Since this is a personal project for learning, I can’t guarantee that every contribution will be merged or that I’ll be able to offer extensive feedback.

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to open a pull request or start a discussion. Thank you for your interest!
